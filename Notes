Todo:

*implementation*

[mainly deprecated; tirc2, a complete rewrite, is on the way.
 But if someone wants to continue with this source; I'll only
 be fixing serious bugs. --mkb]

- write dl api
- place hooks
- integrate modules + -makefiles in configure process

*bugs*

- Scrolling buggers a bit: openbsd+screen -> telnet freebsd host, TERM is pc3,
  tunnelled through screen; bug: top line of each window gets cleared
  [also observed in screen on some systems; this seems to be a bug in the
   terminal description in termcap/terminfo]
- dcc: master client blocks when exiting if slave blocked or sth, ^C cures that
- dumping backscroll in win log seemed to dump only the first 8k
  [not reproducable; was it just a nfs hiccup?]
- spurious segv when editing command line reported (sigalrm race?)
  [seems to be corrected?]
  [sigalrm should not be the culprit anymore, if it was, since I moved
   all critical stuff out of signal handlers now for 1.1.]

*portability*

- still doesn't build properly on nextstep, I think
  [and on hpux, etc.  I don't care about that anymore.]

*proposals*

- include mcl's vhost
  [I think this was supposed to do the same as Vadim Kolontsov's
   bind patch now does.]

General Notes

- if you want to use libefence on *BSD, you might have to modify efence.c
  so that it allows NULL as an argument to free().  The getpwent() function
  obviously calls free with a null pointer.  Standard C allows calling free()
  with a null pointer.
