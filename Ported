Tested TIRC on the following systems:
(unless specified, the native C compiler was used for compiling;
 Note that not all versions have been tested on all of the listed
 platforms, some tests might eventually be outdated)

* OpenBSD (i386) 2.1, 2.2, 2.4 (mkb, mcl)

* FreeBSD (i386) 2.1.0, 2.1.5, 2.1.7, 2.2.x, 3.0 (mkb, mcl, rjc)

* NetBSD (m68k) 1.2 (mkb)

* NetBSD (i386) 1.3 (mkb)

* NetBSD (sparc) 1.3.2 (logix, mkb)

* Digital UNIX (alpha) 3.2, 4.0B (mkb)

* AIX 4.1 (ppc) (mkb)
	Due to a broken setup (no license server running) I was only able
	to try gcc so far; spits out a whole truckload of assembler error
	messages and ld warnings, but works fine
	[no recent versions have been tested on this platform]

* SuSe, RedHat, Slackware, Debian GNU/Linux (i386) (mkb, others)
	Tried with linux revisions around 2.0.30; broken mmap(2)
	Upgrading to the new generic Gnu libc seems to break sys/shm.h
	and/or sys/ipc.h.  TIRC won't compile on these systems.
	There is no workaround available now, except using the older
	Linux libc.

* SunOS 5.5.1, 5.6 (sparc, ultrasparc) (master, shrike, double-p)

* IRIX 5.3 (mips) (mkb)
	Doesn't have posix regexp, using basic regexp instead
	"rm -f" seems to return exit code 1, if one of the files doesn't
	exist.  This may break make clean/distclean;
	type "make clean; make all" in that case
	[no recent versions have been tested on this platform]

* HP-UX 10.10, 10.01b (hppa) (mkb, thanos)
	If you don't have c89 installed (using the castrated compiler),
	mkdep doesn't work as expected.
	That is not a problem, tho, since it does not affect the actual
	compiling.
	---
	TIRC 1.0 does not work on HP-UX 10.10 (at least not when I tested).
	It compiles fine, yet somehow seems to take a long nap after starting.
	I suspect that the snprintf implementation doesn't work on PHUX.
	If anybody would help me with this, and supply a patch or hints,
	I would be grateful.  I don't want to investigate any more in this
	right now.

* SINIX-L/SVR4 5.41 (i386) (hyper)
