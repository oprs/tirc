	TIRC -- Frequently Asked Questions (roughly unsorted)
	+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+
	This FAQ list corresponds to TIRC version 1.1.

Q: Where can I get the latest versions of TIRC?
A: ftp://ftp.mayn.de/pub/unix/software/Network/Irc/tirc

Q: Where can I get further information or discuss the program?
A: There's a low-traffic informal mailing list set up.  Please look at
   the README file for more information.

Q: Is TIRC distributed under the GPL (Gnu General Public License)?
A: No, it isn't.  The author considers the GPL being too complicated
   and too restrictive.  TIRC's license (as stated in the file "COPYRIGHT")
   provides more freedom to all parties than the GPL and is much shorter
   and more comprehensive.

Q: Can I make changes or contribute to TIRC?
A: Yes, you're welcome to do so.  Send me an e-mail if you have questions
   or want to make a proposal of integrating your stuff into the main tree.
   Also read the appropriate stuff in README concerning this topic.

Q: Why doesn't this and that work like in ircII?
A: Why don't you use ircII instead?

Q: That means, I cannot use phoenix or my warskriptz with TIRC?
A: No, TIRC does not support the ircII extension scripting language for
   exactly that reason.

Q: How can I change what TIRC sends to the server as my user@host string?
   I.e., how can I fake the login name to say "kewld00d" instead of
   "user0815"?
A: You cannot, and you shouldn't.  You can override the real name with the
   realname keyword in .tircrc.

Q: Does the DCC RESUME work like in mIRC, are they compatible?
A: It is supposed to be compatible since it implements the mIRC DCC RESUME
   protocol.  I haven't tried it so far and will appreciate reports on that.

Q: Does TIRC then support mIRC colours as well (I've read that TIRC has some
   colour support)?
A: No, mIRC colours are the plague.  You can filter out mIRC inline colours
   with the HIDEMCOL option.

Q: When I log in via telnet and start screen or something with
   my terminal type set to foobar23, I get weird padding at the left
   side of the screen which looks like <42>$ or similar. What's wrong?
A: I've seen this as well.  I think it's a weird termcap entry.
   Set the terminal type to vt220 or xterm (if appropriate) and it'll
   go away.

Q: Can TIRC connect to several IRC servers at once, like ircII with the
   /window server command?
A: No, it cannot and it will never be added.  Just start up a second client
   if you want to chat on several networks at the same time.

Q: How do I report other bugs?
A: Just send me a detailed (as much as possible) description of the bug.
   Don't send me corefiles, but you may send me the stack trace, as displayed
   with a debugger when inspecting the core file.  Configure with
   --enable-debug and try to reproduce the error.  I'd appreciate if you'd
   send the bug report to the mailing list, so that others get to know of
   the bug.  Please use the tircbug script to file bug reports, if possible.

Q: My operating system is listed in the Ported file, yet TIRC doesn't seem
   to build.
A: I don't have the resources to test every version against every system
   listed (for example, I don't have an AIX account anymore).  If it doesn't
   work and you'd like to work it out, please contact me, it should be
   possible to adapt newer versions without much hassle.

Q: The vi emulation of the editor line isn't very complete, I'm missing
   <insert your favourite vi motion here>
A: I know.  But it's just an IRC client, not an editor.  I don't think it
   would be worth the effort to add more vi details.

Q: When I have ANSI-colours enabled, a DCC message that I receive looks
   wrongly coloured, just the =nick gets displayed in the colour I chose.
   What's wrong?
A: Set the HIMSG option to ``off''.  Your terminal switches off colours
   as well when the (bold) attribute is reset.  HIMSG is only really
   useful on monochrome terminals anyway.

Q: How can I prevent that TIRC reads the .tircrc file on every server
   connect?
A: It doesn't.  Since 0.50-alpha, there is the ``immediate'' keyword
   available in the startup files.  Commands tagged immediate will be
   executed once at startup, all others once per successful registration
   with the server.

Q: When I try to compile TIRC on an "up-to-date" Gnu/Linux system,
   with glibc 2.x, shm.c fails to compile.  Why doesn't it work?
A: Upgrading to the generic Gnu glibc from the old Linux Gnu-derived
   libc seems to break /usr/include/sys/ipc.h and /usr/include/sys/shm.h.
   TIRC 1.0 comes with a workaround;  to enable it, invoke configure
   with the --with-linux-glibc option.

Q: I am not running X11, but the terminal/console can change size, can
   I change the size of a running TIRC?
A: Yes.  The following example works on a FreeBSD syscons vty:
   Suspend TIRC, and select your desired size (e.g. vidcontrol VGA_80x30).
   To notify TIRC that screen size has changed, send it SIGWINCH:
   kill -WINCH <pid>.  Then resume TIRC in foreground and it will adapt
   to the new size.  Note: if you're running the fau screen tool (tty
   multiplexer), just detach screen, change size, and reattach.
   Screen obviously doesn't let SIGWINCH through, unfortunately.
   On X11 (if you don't have screen or similar in between), you can simply
   resize TIRC by resizing the terminal window.

Q: How can I type national characters?
A: Since 1.0 release, a bug has been fixed and it works now.
   You have to set your locale correctly, though.  This depends mainly on
   the LANG environment variable.  Refer to your manual pages for the
   correct string.

Q: Year 2000 problems?
A: TIRC does not use 2-digit year representations.

PLEASE NOTE:

The 1.x tree is no longer proactively developed, it will only receive
bug fixes and very small improvements.  Development has moved
(theoretically) to the 2.0 tree, currently I have no time for rewriting
TIRC, this will hopefully change in future.  Also a substantial amount
of work and time has gone into writing this version so I don't feel a
high urge for a rewrite when there are other things to do aswell.
