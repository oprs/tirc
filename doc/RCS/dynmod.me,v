.pp
The TIRC IRC client supports runtime loading and unloading of
shared libraries and dynamic binding of exported functions to TIRC
commands.
.pp
The dlmod interface is mostly functional but still subject to change.
In particular, a more abstract API hasn't yet been specified and
implemented.
.br
The dlmod interface is mostly undocumented in this snapshot.  In future
revisions, this file will contain an elaborate documentation on how to
use and program for the dynamic interface.
